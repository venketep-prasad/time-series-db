/**
 * Interface for unary pipeline stages that operate on a single time series input.
 *
 * <p>Unary pipeline stages perform transformations or aggregations on time series data.
 * They process a single input and produce a single output, making them suitable for
 * operations like mathematical transformations, aggregations, and data filtering.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Common Unary Operations:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Mathematical:</strong> scale, round, offset, abs</li>
 *   <li><strong>Aggregation:</strong> sum, avg, min, max</li>
 *   <li><strong>Transformation:</strong> alias, timeshift, transformNull</li>
 *   <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> removeEmpty, keepLastValue</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Examples:</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Scale all values by 2.0
 * UnaryPipelineStage scaleStage = new ScaleStage(2.0);
 * List<TimeSeries> scaled = scaleStage.process(inputTimeSeries);
 *
 * // Sum values across time series
 * UnaryPipelineStage sumStage = new SumStage("region");
 * List<TimeSeries> summed = sumStage.process(inputTimeSeries);
 * }</pre>
