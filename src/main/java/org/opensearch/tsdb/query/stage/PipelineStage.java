/**
 * Interface for pipeline stages that process time series.
 * Pipeline stages are executed in sequence to transform time series data.
 *
 * <p>This interface defines the contract for all pipeline stages in the time series
 * processing pipeline. Pipeline stages can be unary (operating on a single input)
 * or binary (operating on two inputs), and they transform time series data through
 * various operations such as aggregation, transformation, and filtering.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Features:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Serialization Support:</strong> Extends {@link Writeable} for
 *       distributed processing</li>
 *   <li><strong>XContent Support:</strong> Extends {@link ToXContent} for
 *       JSON serialization</li>
 *   <li><strong>Type Safety:</strong> Provides type-safe processing of time series data</li>
 * </ul>
